# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Python script for playing the game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Game Rules

- The game is played by 1 player and AI.
- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Each cell on the grid is represented by a number from 1 to 9 (an example of the arrangement of numbers is given at the beginning of the game).
- Players take turns and enter the number of the cell they want to place their symbol on.
- The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
